About You by the 1975
lyrics
I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do while we try to recall how we met

[Chorus: Matty Healy]
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?

[Verse 2: Matty Healy, Carly Holt]
You and I (Don't let go)
We're alive (Don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (Don't let go)
And pretend (Don't let go, oh)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (In the end)

[Chorus: Matty Healy]
Do you think I havе forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I havе forgotten
About you?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?

[Bridge: Carly Holt, Matty Healy]
And there was something about you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
And I'll miss you on a train, I'll miss you in the mornin'
I never know what to think about
I think about you (Don't let go)
About you (Don't let go)

[Chorus: Matty Healy, Carly Holt]
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
About you (Don't let go, oh)
About you
About you
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
About you (Don't let go)
